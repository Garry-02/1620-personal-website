    <h2>A paragraph about me</h2>
    <p> My name is <em>Gurjyot "Garry" Singh Mann</em>, I was born and raised in New Delhi, India and I am a student
        at BCIT, enrolled in the CIT program. I like a lot of things and I am easily fascinated by the simplest
        of facts, and hence I love acquiring more and more knowledge in about any field I can possibly find.
        <strong>I love the Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings franchises</strong>, I also love watching anime, playing games, 
        solving puzzles, and helping others. I am an introverted person so it takes me a while to make friends.
        A cool fact about me is that I am ambidextrous, I am good at using both my hands for doing stuff.
