    <p> My name is <em>Gurjyot "Garry" Singh Mann</em>, I was born and raised in New Delhi, India and I am a student
        at BCIT, enrolled in the CIT program.

    <p>
        I like a lot of things and I am easily fascinated by the simplest of facts, and hence I love acquiring more 
        and more knowledge in about any field I can possibly find.

        <strong>I love the Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings franchises</strong>, I also love watching anime, playing games, 
        solving puzzles, and helping others.

        I am an introverted person so it takes me a while to make friends.

        I am a big fan of the football (soccer) team FC Barcelona.
